# TRANSFORM-2021-tutorial: Big Data Lithology Prediction

* The tutorial is on prediction of lithofacies from well log data. It makes use of data from the FORCE 2020 lithology prediction competition.
It covers the following:

* Data Visualization and Exploratory Data ANalysis
* Data Preparation
* Model Training and Prediction
* Model Evaluation
* Model Performance Improvement with different techniques
* * Data Augmentation
* * Cross validation technique
* * Model regularization for better training (for slower weight decay)

It also covers key things to watch out for when working with big subsurface data  like;

* Selecting a proper cross validation technique helps in making more confident decisions
* Preventing overfitting by;
* * Creating different validations sets (give "whys" on choice of method for creating them)
* * Making proper evaluations on validation sets with different metrics
